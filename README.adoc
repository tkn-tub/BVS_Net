BVS is a ns-3 module that simulates the global movement of objects in the human body. It’s main purpose is to model the work environment of medical nanobots. The simulation of nanobots in their working environment is crucial to promote their application in the medical context. Several simulators for nanonetworks investigate new communication paradigms at nanoscale. However, the influence of the environment, namely the human body, on the movement and communication of nanobots was rarely considered so far. Currently there are three open-source nanonetwork ns-3 extension, namely https://telematics.poliba.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30&Itemid=204&lang=en[NanoSim], https://github.com/ieee-p1906-1-reference-code/p1906-dev[p1906] and https://ubnano.tech/nano_downloads/terasim/[TeraSim] that are readily usable. We propose the combination of one of those, or your own nanonetwork simulators with BVS. Our simulator is in a prototypical state at the moment and we’re consistently working on it’s development. At the moment it features a simplified model of a human body’s cardiovascular system to simulate the nanobots’ mobility. Feel free to use BVS and contact us for any remark or contribute to our code. Be sure to have also read our paper describing it.

BVS v2.1 introduces the possibility to model the communication channel, between the nanobots and the gateways, which would in real apllications be situated at the skin level and is in simulation a synthetic data generator for database usage. The mobility model is left unchanged, but we added multiple modules to measure, transmit and receive data. 

If you are looking for a way to visualize the mobility part of the simulation results please visit the extended github for BVS-VIS. 


== New Features
 
  - Models a terahertz channel transmission between nanobots and gateway 
  - Outputs the received packages into a csv file (gateway.csv)
  - Calculates the bit error and package error rate per transmission (gateway_ber.csv)
  - Possibility to have a single run or a multi parameter sweep with respect to tissue thickness.


== Existing features
    
  - 3D coordinates of major vessels and organs
  - Simulates permanent movement of nanobots in cardiovascular system
  - Injection of nanobots in specific vessels

        vector<int> PDU_TX; // Bit stream of measurement data at nanobot

        vector<double> SEQ_TX; // Amplitude stream of measurement data send at nanobot

        vector<double> SEQ_RX; // Amplitude stream of measurement data received at gateway

        vector<int> PDU_RX; // decoded bit stream of measurement data at gateway

=== You’ve already installed ns-3.40

Take the blood-voyager-s version for ns-3.40 and copy the bvs folder in the !!!source location /src!!! of your ns3 version.

=== You're new to ns-3

You need to download the complete ns-3.40(or newer) and follow the instructions in this  https://www.nsnam.org/docs/tutorial/html/getting-started.html[ns-3 tutorial]. Then you download the blood-voyager-s folder from here and put it in the src folder. In addition, you need to put the vasculature.csv in your ns-3.x folder. For further instructions see "Run BVS".




== Run BVS Version ns-3.40 or newer
    SIMDURATION=   # simulation duration in seconds (default 500)
    NUMOFNANOBOTS= # number of nanobots (default 100)
    INJECTVESSEL=  # injection vessel [1-94] (default 29)
	TYPEOFSIMULATION= # 0 is single run and 1 is sweep over vesselthickness (default 0)
	GATEWAYPOSITION= # gateway position [1-94] (default 1)
	TISSUE_ID = # tissue position, where to measure data [1-94] (default 94)
	
   
	./ns3 run "start-bvs --simulationDuration=SIMDURATION, --numOfNanobots=NUMOFNANOBOTS, --injectionVessel=INJECTVESSEL, --typeofsimulation=TYPEOFSIMULATION, --gatewayposition=GATEWAYPOSITION, --tissue_ID=TISSUE_ID"
    or with default values
    ./ns3 run start-bvs
    
The simulation returns:
	- a csv-file (/ns-3.40/csvNano.csv) with the position data of the simulated nanobots in every timestep. 
	- a csv-file (/ns-3.40/gateway.csv) with the transmitted data of the simulated nanobots.
	- a csv-file (/ns-3.40/gateway_ber.csv) with the calcualted ber and per of the simulated nanobots.
